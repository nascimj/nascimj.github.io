##### May 2006 to September 2007, London UK

#### Project

> The main project was to complete the migration of OTC trades from a legacy system (RXM) into the in-house data store and
computation (pricing) engine. The task was like replacing an engine on a moving car. The new messaging server had to
provide seamless integration of newly migrated instruments and legacy ones, without disrupting the upstream and
downstream clients.

#### Summary

- As one of the Lead Developers for the Credit Risk department, I was responsible for managing a
team of six developers, supporting systems and UAT test, and providing training and advice to
second-line support. As the lead developer, I was also in charge of the most challenging aspects of
the system, including the real-time Java based message system.
