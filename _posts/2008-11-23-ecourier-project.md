#### Project

> The company&#39;s mission critical application is a real-time allocation and tracking system that allows customers to book deliveries online, selects the best carrier, and optimises the entire network constantly, ensuring the best and fastest pickup and delivery.

#### Role

Allocation, optimisation, routing: at eCourier the system needed to find the best drivers/vehicle combination (vans, cars, bikes), the most optimal route to pickup and deliver packages, and keep customers and drivers “happy” with up to the minute information about delivery times (optimisation with timewindows).

The back-end system was written in Java, with an MS SQL Server database. As part of the development effort, I wrote a full simulation tool, which allowed us to “replay” events of a day, to fix bugs, and to fine tune the optimisation (quality of service) function and parameters. Also, for good measure, I developed the company’s first Android app, although it was a first attempt at Android development.
