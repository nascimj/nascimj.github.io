#### Project

> AD*Views was a client-server application to allow access to Nielsenâ€™s database
of media audience. Product is licensed to TV stations and advertisement agencies across the United States to track the
performance of ads placed on different media.

#### Summary

- Senior developer, responsible for re-engineering the server side (C++) of the application. The effort
involved a complete redesign and rewrite of more than 100K lines of C++ code, developing a system
of parameterised queries that made the system faster, more reliable, and scalable, by applying OO
design, and decoupling SQL from the C++ code.
The success of the re-engineering effort led to better performance and maintainability, allowing
Nielsen to remain competitive and the product to gain substantial market share.
