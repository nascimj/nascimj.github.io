#### Project

> The company&#39;s mission critical application is a real-time allocation and tracking system that allows customers to book
deliveries online, selects the best carrier, and optimises the entire network constantly, ensuring the best and fastest pickup and delivery.

#### Summary

- Reporting directly to the CTO and CEO, I was responsible for all aspects of development, including a re-design of the code to increase throughput and system's modularity. The new version of the code, and its success in improving the stability and performance of the system was crucial to keep ecourier at the vanguard on the courier business. The company was later sold to a larger organisation, but the allocation/routing/decision making system remained in place.
