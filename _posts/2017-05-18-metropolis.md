##### May 2017 to March 2019, Barcelona, Spain

#### Project

> The Lab was setup as a start-up (although 100% owned by SEAT) to create urban mobility solutions. 

#### Summary

As the Head of the Lab, I played a variety of roles supporting the new company:

- Building a team: We compete for talent on a very hot market and successfully grew from 8 to 18 in one year.
- CPO, CTO: In a small and flat team, part of the job was to maintain direct input and leadership in product and technology too.
- Bridge to SEAT: Reporting back to the CEO and CFO of the company, to ensure that things run smoothly, and that the differences between our fast paced world and the parent company’s more steady one were worked out. 
- Developer: Finally, the one that I probably enjoy the most: writing lots of code for the back end of one of our projects, using Kotlin, Javascript, and even R. 

We were able to successfully develop and deploy two mobility products: a “bus on demand” system and a ridesharing application.
