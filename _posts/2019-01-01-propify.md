#### Project

> Propify is a platform to bring together tenants and landlords that want to escape the high commissions from agencies, and
find a fairer deal, and a quicker rental process. 

#### Summary

As a co-founder and CTO, the role is quite simple: do whatever needs to be done to have the best product we can get out in the market.

- Rebuilding of legacy code in PHP
- Modernizing the platform, reinforcing separation of concerns and a more distributed
approach: React front-end, Lambda functions running a serverless architecture (node.js
and Golang).
- Leveraging a lot of AWS managed services: Cognito, Textract, API Gateway, S3
- And acts as a co-CPO, improving the product and UX, testing/teasing features, and creating a product roadmap.
