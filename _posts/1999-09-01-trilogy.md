#### Project

> Trilogy’s Commission Engine and interface enables business users to build and manage their own compensation plans without the need for IT to get involved.

#### Summary

- The role of the Integration Consultant is to interact with the customer to understand the data structure and flows of their compensation plans, to write software that will extract the data, and transform it into inputs to Trilogy’s Engine, and build an ecosystem of automated tools, scripts, and client applications to give them autonomy in creating, modifying and running their own compensation plans.
