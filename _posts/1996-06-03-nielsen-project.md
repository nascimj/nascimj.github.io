#### Project

> AD*Views was a client-server application to allow access to Nielsenâ€™s database of media audience. Product was licensed to TV stations and advertising agencies across the United States to track the performance of ads placed on different media. 

#### Role

I was hired as the sole C++ developer to maintain the tool. From day one the system presented problems, and after 6 months of intense fire-fighting, we decided that it was time to re-write it completely, observing more closely some fundamental principles of OO. 

The system was built as a free-form asynchronous reporting tool. Clients would request the data sliced in anyway they wanted, mixing years, media, and advertisers. The request was sent to the Database (acting as a message system at this point). The server periodically polled request from the database, and instantiate a reporting engine for each request. Once the query returned the data, it was assembled into a PowerBuilder object and sent back to the client (also via the db).

The effort involved a complete redesign and rewrite of more than 100K lines of C++ code, developing a system of parameterised queries that made the system faster, more reliable, and scalable, by applying OO design, and decoupling SQL from the C++ code.
