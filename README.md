My CV web site, using the theme re-imagined by [arkadianriver.com](http://arkadianriver.com), using the awesome design of http://html5up.net/spectral by the talented [@ajlkn](http://twitter.com/ajlkn).

I hacked it to shoe-horn more of a CV format, while still maintaining the design in place. Hope I did not make much of a mess. I leave the links to the original guides from the author for reference

## Theme note
This is a theme in the old sense of the word. This is not a newer _gem-based_ theme (yet).
