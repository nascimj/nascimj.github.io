  bio: >
     I have been navigating the waters of code and product development for quite some time. With over three decades of experience as a developer, tech lead and CTO, I believe I am uniquely positioned to bring a product from idea to execution.
     <br/><br/>
     My journey started back in the very late 80s, when I left Brazil to pursue a BS degree in Computer Science in Pittsburgh, USA. From there to Florida to complete my Master at the Florida Institute of Technology, and from there to wherever the opportunities led me. I have worked in a variety of roles and in different countries and cultures, in traditional industries from insurance and banking to software and airlines. In the meantime I completed a Postgraduate degree in Economics at the University of London.

     The financial crisis of 2008 was the catalyst for a significant career change, and the embrace of the startup world. The culmination of that process was my 7 years as founding developer and CTO of Hailo, from their humble beginnings on a ship on the Thames to their merge with mytaxi to form Europe's largest e-hailing company.
     <br/><br/>
     After 16 years of London, the sun of Barcelona was calling. I had the privilege to be selected by SEAT to lead their innovation lab (the Metropolis Lab, now SEAT Code). We went from a group of 8 developers to a team of 20+, and more than that, I am proud to have established a culture of trust and openness. After a much needed break to recharge, I was convinced  to roll my sleeves again, and face the challenges of bringing a new startup (Propify - https://propify.es) to life, offering a fairer deal for landlords and tenants.
